Holder of a Master 2 in econometrics, I am mainly specialized in the realization of statistical work of a descriptive but also predictive nature. I am also endowed with theoretical knowledge in economics and econometrics as well as technical skills in programming (R, Python, SQL) that allow me to answer various economic problems.

After a rewarding experience as a Data analyst at LSA Courtage in the Supply and Profitability Department, I subsequently joined the Aon group as a Statistical Studies Officer in the automotive technical department, position I currently hold.

Please find attached my resume :
